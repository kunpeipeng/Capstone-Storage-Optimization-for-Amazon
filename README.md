# Capstone-Storage-Optimization-for-Amazon

This is my capstone project that concludes my M.S. in Business Analytics degree at the University of Washington - Foster School of Business.

The goal of this project is to optimize(automate) the item classification step in Amazon Global Specialty Fulfilment item storage facilities. We developed a multi-class classification model based on features engineered using NLP techniques, such as term frequency encoding, to accurately predict the right storage zone for each item. The eventual model accuracy was about 88%, which was very close to the empirical human accuracy of 90%. Meanwhile, we can hypothetically save about $209k for each Amazon GSF storage facility where the model is deployed. 

The entire project was completed in the course of 9 weeks, which was fairly challenging given that we were taking 3 other classes. (3 of us were taking on another marketing analytics project for Nestle-Starbucks Coffee Partners during the same time.) On top of the tight deadline, we were also learning Python and Natural Language Processing technique extensively for the first time in our program. Despite all challenges, we were able to deliver working models with fully documented python script for the stakeholders. 

NOTE: We're not able to provide the data files here because they are proprietary to Amazon.com.
